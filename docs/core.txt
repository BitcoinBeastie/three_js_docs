BufferAttribute
This class stores data for an attribute (such as vertex positions, face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and any custom attributes ) associated with a BufferGeometry, which allows for more efficient passing of data to the GPU. See that page for details and a usage example. When working with vector-like data, the .fromBufferAttribute( attribute, index ) helper methods on Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, and Color classes may be helpful.

Constructor
BufferAttribute( array : TypedArray, itemSize : Integer, normalized : Boolean )
array -- Must be a TypedArray. Used to instantiate the buffer.
This array should have
itemSize * numVertices
elements, where numVertices is the number of vertices in the associated BufferGeometry.

itemSize -- the number of values of the array that should be associated with a particular vertex. For instance, if this attribute is storing a 3-component vector (such as a position, normal, or color), then itemSize should be 3.

normalized -- (optional) Applies to integer data only. Indicates how the underlying data in the buffer maps to the values in the GLSL code. For instance, if array is an instance of UInt16Array, and normalized is true, the values 0 - +65535 in the array data will be mapped to 0.0f - +1.0f in the GLSL attribute. An Int16Array (signed) would map from -32768 - +32767 to -1.0f - +1.0f. If normalized is false, the values will be converted to floats unmodified, i.e. 32767 becomes 32767.0f.

Properties
.array : TypedArray
The array holding data stored in the buffer.

.count : Integer
Represents the number of items this buffer attribute stores. It is internally computed by dividing the array's length by the itemSize. Read-only property.

.gpuType : Number
Configures the bound GPU type for use in shaders. Either THREE.FloatType or THREE.IntType, default is THREE.FloatType. Note: this only has an effect for integer arrays and is not configurable for float arrays. For lower precision float types, see THREE.Float16BufferAttribute.

.isBufferAttribute : Boolean
Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type BufferAttribute.

.id : Integer
Unique number for this attribute instance.

.itemSize : Integer
The length of vectors that are being stored in the array.

.name : String
Optional name for this attribute instance. Default is an empty string.

.needsUpdate : Boolean
Flag to indicate that this attribute has changed and should be re-sent to the GPU. Set this to true when you modify the value of the array.

Setting this to true also increments the version.

.normalized : Boolean
Indicates how the underlying data in the buffer maps to the values in the GLSL shader code. See the constructor above for details.

.onUploadCallback : Function
A callback function that is executed after the Renderer has transferred the attribute array data to the GPU.

.updateRanges : Object
Array of objects containing:
start: Position at which to start update.
count: The number of components to update.

This can be used to only update some components of stored vectors (for example, just the component related to color). Use the addUpdateRange function to add ranges to this array.

.usage : Usage
Defines the intended usage pattern of the data store for optimization purposes. Corresponds to the usage parameter of WebGLRenderingContext.bufferData(). Default is StaticDrawUsage. See usage constants for all possible values.

Note: After the initial use of a buffer, its usage cannot be changed. Instead, instantiate a new one and set the desired usage before the next render.

.version : Integer
A version number, incremented every time the needsUpdate property is set to true.

BufferGeometry
A representation of mesh, line, or point geometry. Includes vertex positions, face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers, reducing the cost of passing all this data to the GPU.

To read and edit data in BufferGeometry attributes, see BufferAttribute documentation.

Code Example
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();

// create a simple square shape. We duplicate the top left and bottom right
// vertices because each vertex needs to appear once per triangle.
const vertices = new Float32Array( [
	-1.0, -1.0,  1.0, // v0
	 1.0, -1.0,  1.0, // v1
	 1.0,  1.0,  1.0, // v2

	 1.0,  1.0,  1.0, // v3
	-1.0,  1.0,  1.0, // v4
	-1.0, -1.0,  1.0  // v5
] );

// itemSize = 3 because there are 3 values (components) per vertex
geometry.setAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( vertices, 3 ) );
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );
Code Example (Index)
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();

const vertices = new Float32Array( [
	-1.0, -1.0,  1.0, // v0
	 1.0, -1.0,  1.0, // v1
	 1.0,  1.0,  1.0, // v2
	-1.0,  1.0,  1.0, // v3
] );

const indices = [
	0, 1, 2,
	2, 3, 0,
];

geometry.setIndex( indices );
geometry.setAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( vertices, 3 ) );

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

Constructor
BufferGeometry()
This creates a new BufferGeometry. It also sets several properties to a default value.
Properties
.attributes : Object
This hashmap has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value the buffer to set it to. Rather than accessing this property directly, use .setAttribute and .getAttribute to access attributes of this geometry.

.boundingBox : Box3
Bounding box for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with .computeBoundingBox(). Default is null.

.boundingSphere : Sphere
Bounding sphere for the bufferGeometry, which can be calculated with .computeBoundingSphere(). Default is null.

.drawRange : Object
Determines the part of the geometry to render. This should not be set directly, instead use .setDrawRange. Default is
{ start: 0, count: Infinity }
For non-indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of vertices to render. For indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of indices to render.

.groups : Array
Split the geometry into groups, each of which will be rendered in a separate WebGL draw call. This allows an array of materials to be used with the geometry.

Each group is an object of the form:
{ start: Integer, count: Integer, materialIndex: Integer }
where start specifies the first element in this draw call – the first vertex for non-indexed geometry, otherwise the first triangle index. Count specifies how many vertices (or indices) are included, and materialIndex specifies the material array index to use.

Use .addGroup to add groups, rather than modifying this array directly.

Every vertex and index must belong to exactly one group — groups must not share vertices or indices, and must not leave vertices or indices unused.

.id : Integer
Unique number for this bufferGeometry instance.

.index : BufferAttribute
Allows for vertices to be re-used across multiple triangles; this is called using "indexed triangles". Each triangle is associated with the indices of three vertices. This attribute therefore stores the index of each vertex for each triangular face. If this attribute is not set, the renderer assumes that each three contiguous positions represent a single triangle. Default is null.

.isBufferGeometry : Boolean
Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type BufferGeometry.

.morphAttributes : Object
Hashmap of BufferAttributes holding details of the geometry's morph targets.
Note: Once the geometry has been rendered, the morph attribute data cannot be changed. You will have to call .dispose(), and create a new instance of BufferGeometry.

.morphTargetsRelative : Boolean
Used to control the morph target behavior; when set to true, the morph target data is treated as relative offsets, rather than as absolute positions/normals. Default is false.

.name : String
Optional name for this bufferGeometry instance. Default is an empty string.

.userData : Object
An object that can be used to store custom data about the BufferGeometry. It should not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned. Default is an empty object {}.

.uuid : String
UUID of this object instance. This gets automatically assigned and shouldn't be edited.

Methods
EventDispatcher methods are available on this class.

.addGroup ( start : Integer, count : Integer, materialIndex : Integer ) : undefined
Adds a group to this geometry; see the groups property for details.

.applyMatrix4 ( matrix : Matrix4 ) : this
Applies the matrix transform to the geometry.

.applyQuaternion ( quaternion : Quaternion ) : this
Applies the rotation represented by the quaternion to the geometry.

.center () : this
Center the geometry based on the bounding box.

.clearGroups ( ) : undefined
Clears all groups.

.clone () : BufferGeometry
Creates a clone of this BufferGeometry.

.computeBoundingBox () : undefined
Computes the bounding box of the geometry, and updates the .boundingBox attribute. The bounding box is not computed by the engine; it must be computed by your app. You may need to recompute the bounding box if the geometry vertices are modified.

.computeBoundingSphere () : undefined
Computes the bounding sphere of the geometry, and updates the .boundingSphere attribute. The engine automatically computes the bounding sphere when it is needed, e.g., for ray casting or view frustum culling. You may need to recompute the bounding sphere if the geometry vertices are modified.

.computeTangents () : undefined
Calculates and adds a tangent attribute to this geometry.
The computation is only supported for indexed geometries and if position, normal, and uv attributes are defined. When using a tangent space normal map, prefer the MikkTSpace algorithm provided by BufferGeometryUtils.computeMikkTSpaceTangents instead.

.computeVertexNormals () : undefined
Computes vertex normals for the given vertex data. For indexed geometries, the method sets each vertex normal to be the average of the face normals of the faces that share that vertex. For non-indexed geometries, vertices are not shared, and the method sets each vertex normal to be the same as the face normal.

.copy ( bufferGeometry : BufferGeometry ) : this
Copies another BufferGeometry to this BufferGeometry.

.deleteAttribute ( name : String ) : BufferAttribute
Deletes the attribute with the specified name.

.dispose () : undefined
Frees the GPU-related resources allocated by this instance. Call this method whenever this instance is no longer used in your app.

.getAttribute ( name : String ) : BufferAttribute
Returns the attribute with the specified name.

.getIndex () : BufferAttribute
Return the .index buffer.

.hasAttribute ( name : String ) : Boolean
Returns true if the attribute with the specified name exists.

.lookAt ( vector : Vector3 ) : this
vector - A world vector to look at.

Rotates the geometry to face a point in space. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.lookAt for typical real-time mesh usage.

.normalizeNormals () : undefined
Every normal vector in a geometry will have a magnitude of 1. This will correct lighting on the geometry surfaces.

.rotateX ( radians : Float ) : this
Rotate the geometry about the X axis. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.rotation for typical real-time mesh rotation.

.rotateY ( radians : Float ) : this
Rotate the geometry about the Y axis. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.rotation for typical real-time mesh rotation.

.rotateZ ( radians : Float ) : this
Rotate the geometry about the Z axis. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.rotation for typical real-time mesh rotation.

.scale ( x : Float, y : Float, z : Float ) : this
Scale the geometry data. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.scale for typical real-time mesh scaling.

.setAttribute ( name : String, attribute : BufferAttribute ) : this
Sets an attribute to this geometry. Use this rather than the attributes property, because an internal hashmap of .attributes is maintained to speed up iterating over attributes.

.setDrawRange ( start : Integer, count : Integer ) : undefined
Set the .drawRange property. For non-indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of vertices to render. For indexed BufferGeometry, count is the number of indices to render.

.setFromPoints ( points : Array ) : this
Defines a geometry by creating a position attribute based on the given array of points. The array can hold instances of Vector2 or Vector3. When using two-dimensional data, the z coordinate for all vertices is set to 0.
If the method is used with an existing position attribute, the vertex data are overwritten with the data from the array. The length of the array must match the vertex count.

.setIndex ( index : BufferAttribute ) : this
Set the .index buffer.

.toJSON () : Object
Convert the buffer geometry to three.js JSON Object/Scene format.

.toNonIndexed () : BufferGeometry
Return a non-index version of an indexed BufferGeometry.

.translate ( x : Float, y : Float, z : Float ) : this
Translate the geometry. This is typically done as a one time operation, and not during a loop. Use Object3D.position for typical real-time mesh translation.

GLBufferAttribute
This buffer attribute class does not construct a VBO. Instead, it uses whatever VBO is passed in constructor and can later be altered via the buffer property.

It is required to pass additional params alongside the VBO. Those are: the GL context, the GL data type, the number of components per vertex, the number of bytes per component, and the number of vertices.

The most common use case for this class is when some kind of GPGPU calculation interferes or even produces the VBOs in question.

Constructor
GLBufferAttribute( buffer : WebGLBuffer, type : GLenum, itemSize : Integer, elementSize : Integer, count : Integer )
buffer — Must be a WebGLBuffer.
type — One of WebGL Data Types.
itemSize — The number of values of the array that should be associated with a particular vertex. For instance, if this attribute is storing a 3-component vector (such as a position, normal, or color), then itemSize should be 3.
elementSize — 1, 2 or 4. The corresponding size (in bytes) for the given "type" param.

gl.FLOAT: 4
gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT: 2
gl.SHORT: 2
gl.UNSIGNED_INT: 4
gl.INT: 4
gl.BYTE: 1
gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE: 1
count — The expected number of vertices in VBO.

Sets the buffer property.

.setType ( type, elementSize ) : this
Sets the both type and elementSize properties.

.setItemSize ( itemSize ) : this

Layers
A Layers object assigns an Object3D to 1 or more of 32 layers numbered 0 to 31 - internally the layers are stored as a bit mask, and by default all Object3Ds are a member of layer 0.

This can be used to control visibility - an object must share a layer with a camera to be visible when that camera's view is rendered.

All classes that inherit from Object3D have an Object3D.layers property which is an instance of this class.

Examples
WebGL / layers

Object3D
This is the base class for most objects in three.js and provides a set of properties and methods for manipulating objects in 3D space.

Array with object's children. See Group for info on manually grouping objects.

.customDepthMaterial : Material
Custom depth material to be used when rendering to the depth map. Can only be used in context of meshes. When shadow-casting with a DirectionalLight or SpotLight, if you are modifying vertex positions in the vertex shader you must specify a customDepthMaterial for proper shadows. Default is undefined.

.customDistanceMaterial : Material
Same as customDepthMaterial, but used with PointLight. Default is undefined.

.frustumCulled : Boolean
When this is set, it checks every frame if the object is in the frustum of the camera before rendering the object. If set to false the object gets rendered every frame even if it is not in the frustum of the camera. Default is true.

.id : Integer
readonly – Unique number for this object instance.

.isObject3D : Boolean
Read-only flag to check if a given object is of type Object3D.

.layers : Layers
The layer membership of the object. The object is only visible if it has at least one layer in common with the Camera in use. This property can also be used to filter out unwanted objects in ray-intersection tests when using Raycaster.

.matrix : Matrix4
The local transform matrix.

.matrixAutoUpdate : Boolean
When this is set, it calculates the matrix of position, (rotation or quaternion) and scale every frame and also recalculates the matrixWorld property. Default is Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE (true).

.matrixWorld : Matrix4
The global transform of the object. If the Object3D has no parent, then it's identical to the local transform .matrix.

.matrixWorldAutoUpdate : Boolean
If set, then the renderer checks every frame if the object and its children need matrix updates. When it isn't, then you have to maintain all matrices in the object and its children yourself. Default is Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE (true).

.matrixWorldNeedsUpdate : Boolean
When this is set, it calculates the matrixWorld in that frame and resets this property to false. Default is false.

.modelViewMatrix : Matrix4
This is passed to the shader and used to calculate the position of the object.

.name : String
Optional name of the object (doesn't need to be unique). Default is an empty string.

.normalMatrix : Matrix3
This is passed to the shader and used to calculate lighting for the object. It is the transpose of the inverse of the upper left 3x3 sub-matrix of this object's modelViewMatrix.

The reason for this special matrix is that simply using the modelViewMatrix could result in a non-unit length of normals (on scaling) or in a non-perpendicular direction (on non-uniform scaling).

On the other hand the translation part of the modelViewMatrix is not relevant for the calculation of normals. Thus a Matrix3 is sufficient.

.onAfterRender : Function
An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for renderable 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and materials like instances of Mesh, Line, Points or Sprite. Instances of Object3D, Group or Bone are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

.onAfterShadow : Function
An optional callback that is executed immediately after a 3D object is rendered to a shadow map. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, shadowCamera, geometry, depthMaterial, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for renderable 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and materials like instances of Mesh, Line, Points or Sprite. Instances of Object3D, Group or Bone are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

.onBeforeRender : Function
An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is rendered. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, geometry, material, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for renderable 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and materials like instances of Mesh, Line, Points or Sprite. Instances of Object3D, Group or Bone are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

.onBeforeShadow : Function
An optional callback that is executed immediately before a 3D object is rendered to a shadow map. This function is called with the following parameters: renderer, scene, camera, shadowCamera, geometry, depthMaterial, group.

Please notice that this callback is only executed for renderable 3D objects. Meaning 3D objects which define their visual appearance with geometries and materials like instances of Mesh, Line, Points or Sprite. Instances of Object3D, Group or Bone are not renderable and thus this callback is not executed for such objects.

.parent : Object3D
Object's parent in the scene graph. An object can have at most one parent.

.position : Vector3
A Vector3 representing the object's local position. Default is (0, 0, 0).

.quaternion : Quaternion
Object's local rotation as a Quaternion.

.receiveShadow : Boolean
Whether the material receives shadows. Default is false.

.renderOrder : Number
This value allows the default rendering order of scene graph objects to be overridden although opaque and transparent objects remain sorted independently. When this property is set for an instance of Group, all descendants objects will be sorted and rendered together. Sorting is from lowest to highest renderOrder. Default value is 0.

.rotation : Euler
Object's local rotation (see Euler angles), in radians.

.scale : Vector3
The object's local scale. Default is Vector3( 1, 1, 1 ).

.up : Vector3
This is used by the lookAt method, for example, to determine the orientation of the result.
Default is Object3D.DEFAULT_UP - that is, ( 0, 1, 0 ).

.userData : Object
An object that can be used to store custom data about the Object3D. It should not hold references to functions as these will not be cloned. Default is an empty object {}.

.uuid : String
UUID of this object instance. This gets automatically assigned, so this shouldn't be edited.

.visible : Boolean
Object gets rendered if true. Default is true.

Static Properties
Static properties and methods are defined per class rather than per instance of that class. This means that changing Object3D.DEFAULT_UP or Object3D.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE will change the values of up and matrixAutoUpdate for every instance of Object3D (or derived classes) created after the change has been made (already created Object3Ds will not be affected).

.DEFAULT_UP : Vector3
The default up direction for objects, also used as the default position for DirectionalLight, HemisphereLight and Spotlight (which creates lights shining from the top down).
Set to ( 0, 1, 0 ) by default.

.DEFAULT_MATRIX_AUTO_UPDATE : Boolean
The default setting for matrixAutoUpdate for newly created Object3Ds.

.DEFAULT_MATRIX_WORLD_AUTO_UPDATE : Boolean
The default setting for matrixWorldAutoUpdate for newly created Object3Ds.

Raycaster
This class is designed to assist with raycasting. Raycasting is used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3d space the mouse is over) amongst other things.

Code Example
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
const pointer = new THREE.Vector2();

function onPointerMove( event ) {

	// calculate pointer position in normalized device coordinates
	// (-1 to +1) for both components

	pointer.x = ( event.clientX / window.innerWidth ) * 2 - 1;
	pointer.y = - ( event.clientY / window.innerHeight ) * 2 + 1;

}

function render() {

	// update the picking ray with the camera and pointer position
	raycaster.setFromCamera( pointer, camera );

	// calculate objects intersecting the picking ray
	const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children );

	for ( let i = 0; i < intersects.length; i ++ ) {

		intersects[ i ].object.material.color.set( 0xff0000 );

	}

	renderer.render( scene, camera );

}

window.addEventListener( 'pointermove', onPointerMove );

window.requestAnimationFrame(render);
Examples
Raycasting to a Mesh
Raycasting to a Mesh in using an OrthographicCamera
Raycasting to a Mesh with BufferGeometry
Raycasting to a InstancedMesh
Raycasting to a Line
Raycasting to Points
Terrain raycasting
Raycasting to paint voxels
Raycast to a Texture

Constructor
Raycaster( origin : Vector3, direction : Vector3, near : Float, far : Float )
origin — The origin vector where the ray casts from.
direction — The direction vector that gives direction to the ray. Should be normalized.
near — All results returned are further away than near. Near can't be negative. Default value is 0.
far — All results returned are closer than far. Far can't be lower than near. Default value is Infinity.

This creates a new raycaster object.

Properties
.far : Float
The far factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the distance. This value shouldn't be negative and should be larger than the near property.

.near : Float
The near factor of the raycaster. This value indicates which objects can be discarded based on the distance. This value shouldn't be negative and should be smaller than the far property.

.camera : Camera
The camera to use when raycasting against view-dependent objects such as billboarded objects like Sprites. This field can be set manually or is set when calling "setFromCamera". Defaults to null.

.layers : Layers
Used by Raycaster to selectively ignore 3D objects when performing intersection tests. The following code example ensures that only 3D objects on layer 1 will be honored by the instance of Raycaster.
raycaster.layers.set( 1 );
object.layers.enable( 1 );

.params : Object
An object with the following properties:
{
	Mesh: {},
	Line: { threshold: 1 },
	LOD: {},
	Points: { threshold: 1 },
	Sprite: {}
}
Where threshold is the precision of the raycaster when intersecting objects, in world units.

.ray : Ray
The Ray used for the raycasting.

Methods
.set ( origin : Vector3, direction : Vector3) : undefined
origin — The origin vector where the ray casts from.
direction — The normalized direction vector that gives direction to the ray.

Updates the ray with a new origin and direction. Please note that this method only copies the values from the arguments.

.setFromCamera ( coords : Vector2, camera : Camera ) : undefined
coords — 2D coordinates of the mouse, in normalized device coordinates (NDC)---X and Y components should be between -1 and 1.
camera — camera from which the ray should originate

Updates the ray with a new origin and direction.

.setFromXRController ( controller : WebXRController ) : this
controller — The controller to copy the position and direction from.

Updates the ray with a new origin and direction.

.intersectObject ( object : Object3D, recursive : Boolean, optionalTarget : Array ) : Array
object — The object to check for intersection with the ray.
recursive — If true, it also checks all descendants. Otherwise it only checks intersection with the object. Default is true.
optionalTarget — (optional) target to set the result. Otherwise a new Array is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).

Checks all intersection between the ray and the object with or without the descendants. Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first. An array of intersections is returned...

 [ { distance, point, face, faceIndex, object }, ... ] 
distance – distance between the origin of the ray and the intersection
distanceToRay – Some objects (f.e. Points) provide the distance of the intersection to the nearest point on the ray. For other objects it will be undefined
point – point of intersection, in world coordinates
face – intersected face
faceIndex – index of the intersected face
object – the intersected object
uv - U,V coordinates at point of intersection
uv1 - Second set of U,V coordinates at point of intersection
normal - interpolated normal vector at point of intersection
instanceId – The index number of the instance where the ray intersects the InstancedMesh

Raycaster delegates to the raycast method of the passed object, when evaluating whether the ray intersects the object or not. This allows meshes to respond differently to ray casting than lines and pointclouds.

Note that for meshes, faces must be pointed towards the origin of the ray in order to be detected; intersections of the ray passing through the back of a face will not be detected. To raycast against both faces of an object, you'll want to set the material's side property to THREE.DoubleSide.

.intersectObjects ( objects : Array, recursive : Boolean, optionalTarget : Array ) : Array
objects — The objects to check for intersection with the ray.
recursive — If true, it also checks all descendants of the objects. Otherwise it only checks intersection with the objects. Default is true.
optionalTarget — (optional) target to set the result. Otherwise a new Array is instantiated. If set, you must clear this array prior to each call (i.e., array.length = 0;).

Checks all intersection between the ray and the objects with or without the descendants. Intersections are returned sorted by distance, closest first. Intersections are of the same form as those returned by .intersectObject.

Uniform
Uniforms are global GLSL variables. They are passed to shader programs.

Code Example
When declaring a uniform of a ShaderMaterial, it is declared by value or by object.

uniforms: {
	time: { value: 1.0 }, 
	resolution: new Uniform( new Vector2() )
};
Uniform types
Each uniform must have a value property. The type of the value must correspond to the type of the uniform variable in the GLSL code as specified for the primitive GLSL types in the table below. Uniform structures and arrays are also supported. GLSL arrays of primitive type must either be specified as an array of the corresponding THREE objects or as a flat array containing the data of all the objects. In other words; GLSL primitives in arrays must not be represented by arrays. This rule does not apply transitively. An array of vec2 arrays, each with a length of five vectors, must be an array of arrays, of either five Vector2 objects or ten numbers.

Uniform types
GLSL type	JavaScript type
int	Number
uint	Number
float	Number
bool	Boolean
bool	Number
vec2	THREE.Vector2
vec2	Float32Array (*)
vec2	Array (*)
vec3	THREE.Vector3
vec3	THREE.Color
vec3	Float32Array (*)
vec3	Array (*)
vec4	THREE.Vector4
vec4	THREE.Quaternion
vec4	Float32Array (*)
vec4	Array (*)
mat2	Float32Array (*)
mat2	Array (*)
mat3	THREE.Matrix3
mat3	Float32Array (*)
mat3	Array (*)
mat4	THREE.Matrix4
mat4	Float32Array (*)
mat4	Array (*)
ivec2, bvec2	Float32Array (*)
ivec2, bvec2	Array (*)
ivec3, bvec3	Int32Array (*)
ivec3, bvec3	Array (*)
ivec4, bvec4	Int32Array (*)
ivec4, bvec4	Array (*)
sampler2D	THREE.Texture
samplerCube	THREE.CubeTexture
(*) Same for an (innermost) array (dimension) of the same GLSL type, containing the components of all vectors or matrices in the array.

Structured Uniforms
Sometimes you want to organize uniforms as structs in your shader code. The following style must be used so three.js is able to process structured uniform data.

uniforms = {
	data: { 
		value: {
			position: new Vector3(), 
			direction: new Vector3( 0, 0, 1 ) 
		} 
	} 
};
This definition can be mapped on the following GLSL code:
struct Data { 
	vec3 position;
	vec3 direction;
};
uniform Data data;
Structured Uniforms with Arrays
It's also possible to manage structs in arrays. The syntax for this use case looks like so:

const entry1 = {
	position: new Vector3(),
	direction: new Vector3( 0, 0, 1 )
};
const entry2 = {
	position: new Vector3( 1, 1, 1 ),
	direction: new Vector3( 0, 1, 0 )
};

uniforms = {
	data: {
		value: [ entry1, entry2 ]
	}
};
This definition can be mapped on the following GLSL code:
struct Data { 
	vec3 position; 
	vec3 direction; 
};
uniform Data data[ 2 ];
Constructor
Uniform( value : Object )
value -- An object containing the value to set up the uniform. It's type must be one of the Uniform Types described above.

Properties
.value : Object
Current value of the uniform.

Methods
.clone () : Uniform
Returns a clone of this uniform.
If the uniform's value property is an Object with a clone() method, this is used, otherwise the value is copied by assignment. Array values are shared between cloned Uniforms.
